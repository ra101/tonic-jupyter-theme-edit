## Install
### Jupyter <4.0
Put the `custom.css` file in the folder `~/.ipython/profile_default/static/custom/`.
You probable have to create the `static` and `custom` folders.

### Jupyter >4.0
Jupyter got updated, the new location for the `custom.css` is `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css`.
You have to create the `custom` folder.
